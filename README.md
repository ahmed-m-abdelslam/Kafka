Object Detection and Watermarking System
This repository contains code for an object detection and watermarking system using Kafka for message passing and image processing libraries like OpenCV and PIL.

1. Components
  1. Server
  File: server.py
  This file contains the code for running the server. It listens for HTTP requests and handles storing watermarked images in the database.

  2. Consmodel
  File: consmodel.py
  This file includes the consumer code responsible for receiving messages from Kafka topics. It utilizes an object detection model to identify objects in images.

  3. Conswatermark
  File: conswatermark.py
  This file is responsible for applying watermarks to images. It listens for messages from Kafka, processes images, applies watermarks, and replaces the original images in the database.

2. Usage
  1. Start the server by running server.py.
  2. Run consmodel.py to initialize the Kafka consumer and the object detection model.
  3. Execute conswatermark.py to apply watermarks to images and replace them in the database.
Make sure to configure the Kafka broker settings and database connection details in the respective files before running the system.

3. Dependencies
  1. confluent_kafka: Python client for Apache Kafka
  2. opencv-python: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks
  3. Pillow: Python Imaging Library for image processing
  4. Other standard Python libraries
